# Ex Libris
This is a Sinatra app that allows Goodreads users to view books in their 'Owned Books' list and add new books to their library.

Toggle between unread books in your library and all of your owned books by selecting the links in the navigation bar. 

To add a new book to your library, search for the book name in the search bar and select the correct book from the results list.

# Set Up
Download the repository, then run `bundle install` from the command line to install necessary Ruby components.

Run `rackup` to launch the application at http://localhost:9292.
